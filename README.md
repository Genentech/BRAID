# Welcome to the BRAID website

**BRAID** is a department within Genentech dedicated to advancing biological and clinical sciences through artificial intelligence. Our core focus is on developing foundation models—general-purpose AI models trained on large-scale biological datasets—which we fine-tune for specialized applications. 

At BRAID, we not only develop cutting-edge AI tools but also actively use them to advance scientific discovery. All our tools are made available to the scientific community through the links on this page. We always welcome feedback—feel free to contact [Tommaso](mailto:biancalt@gene.com) or the [BRAID leadership team](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/braid) with any input or suggestions.
