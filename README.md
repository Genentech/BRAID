**BRAID** is a department within Genentech dedicated to advancing biological and clinical sciences through artificial intelligence. Our core focus is on developing foundation models—general-purpose AI models trained on large-scale biological datasets—which we fine-tune for specialized applications. Our research spans multiple areas, with key focuses including:

- **High-throughput perturbative screening** for target identification and drug discovery, utilizing technologies such as cell painting, Perturb-seq, and optical pooled screens.
- **Regulatory element design** for gene and cell therapy applications.
- **Integration of multi-modal biological data** to improve target assessment.
- **Inference of cellular communication** using spatial transcriptomics and proteomics.
- **Virtual screening** of small molecules for phenotypic drug discovery.
- **Foundational machine learning**, focusing on fine-tuning foundation models, generative modeling, causal inference, explainability, and uncertainty quantification.

At BRAID, we not only develop cutting-edge AI tools but also actively use them to advance scientific discovery. Additionally, all our tools are made available to the scientific community through the links on this site. We always welcome feedback—feel free to contact Tommaso at [biancalt@gene.com](mailto:biancalt@gene.com) with any input or suggestions.
